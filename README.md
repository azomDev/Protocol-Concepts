# Protocol Concepts

This repository contains a collection of custom-designed protocols. These protocols are purely theoretical and are intended to showcase my approach to designing secure communication, authentication, and encryption protocols. They are written as specifications and are not accompanied by any actual implementation code.

## Important Notice

- **Auditing**: These protocols have **not** been audited by security professionals.
- **Verification**: The security and correctness of these protocols **have not been verified**. Use them at your own risk.
- **Future Updates**: I may or may not update or improve these protocols in the future. At the moment, they are provided as theoretical models only.

## Protocols

Each protocol is presented in text format and is intended to illustrate a conceptual design. You can explore each protocol in detail by navigating through the individual files in this repository.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions, improvements, or critiques, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. However, please keep in mind that this repository is for educational and theoretical purposes.

## Disclaimer

These protocols are designed for **academic** and **conceptual** purposes only. They are not suitable for production systems without rigorous security auditing and validation. I do not take responsibility for any misuse or vulnerabilities that may arise from using these protocols.
